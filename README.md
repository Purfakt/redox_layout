# Purfakt's redox layout

This is my custom redox layout. It's basically the default layout with the `left shift` and `alt` keys swapped.

I also added a 4th layer which:
- brings back `left shift` to the left side,
- switches `enter` and `space` with `backspace` and `delete`, 
- removes the `super` key,
- replaces `page up` and `page down` with `m` and `i`.
