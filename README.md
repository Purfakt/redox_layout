# Purfakt's redox layout

This is my custom [redox](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard) keyboard layout. It's basically the default layout with the `left shift` and `alt` keys swapped.

I added a 4th (gaming) layer which:
- brings back `left shift` to the left side,
- switches `enter` and `space` with `backspace` and `delete`, 
- removes the `super` key,
- replaces `page up` and `page down` with `m` and `i`.

The 5th layout is a modified version of [RSTHD](https://xsznix.wordpress.com/2016/05/16/introducing-the-rsthd-layout/).


Made with [config.qmk.fm](https://config.qmk.fm/).

## Changed layers

Layers 2 and 3 are not shown as they are the same as the [default layout](https://config.qmk.fm/#/redox/rev1/LAYOUT)
